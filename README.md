# Feedback Analyzer (Python)

# Project Description
Feedback Analyzer is a beginner-friendly Python project that analyzes user feedback text and counts positive and negative words.  
This project is built using core Python concepts and is designed as a foundation for future AI/ML and NLP-based improvements.


# Project Objective
- Practice Python file handling
- Learn basic text preprocessing
- Understand how simple sentiment analysis works


# Technologies Used
- Python 3
- File Handling
- String Manipulation
- Lists and Loops

# How It Works
1. Reads feedback from a text file
2. Converts text to lowercase
3. Removes punctuation marks
4. Splits text into words
5. Counts positive and negative words
6. Displays sentiment counts


# How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure Python 3 is installed
3. Run the script:
bash
python feedback_analyzer.py

   
# Sample Output
Positive count = 5
Negative count = 2


# Future Improvements
Add word frequency analysis
Use NLP libraries (NLTK / spaCy)
Convert to a Flask web app
Visualize results using graphs
Upgrade to ML-based sentiment analysis
